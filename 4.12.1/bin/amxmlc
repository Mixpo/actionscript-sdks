# amxmlc script for Unix.
# This simply executes the mxmlc script in the same directory,
# inserting the option +configname=air, which makes
# mxmlc use air-config.xml rather than flex-config.xml.
# On Windows, amxmlc.bat is used instead.

#
# Either the AIR_HOME environment variable must be set or
# or the env.AIR_HOME property must be set in %FLEX_HOME%/env.properties.
# If both are set the property takes precedence.
