 Easing Equations v2.0
 September 1, 2003
 (c) 2003 Robert Penner, all rights reserved. 
 This work is subject to the terms in http://www.robertpenner.com/easing_terms_of_use.html.
============================================================================================

These tweening functions provide different flavors of 
math-based motion under a consistent API. 

Types of easing:

      Linear
      Quadratic
      Cubic
      Quartic
      Quintic
      Sinusoidal
      Exponential
      Circular
      Elastic
      Back
      Bounce

Changes:
3.0 - ported to ActionScript 3.0; Added ASDoc comments
2.0 - ported to ActionScript 2.0; functions now in packages and use strong typing
1.5 - added bounce easing
1.4 - added elastic and back easing
1.3 - tweaked the exponential easing functions to make endpoints exact
1.2 - inline optimizations (changing t and multiplying in one step)--thanks to Tatsuo Kato for the idea

Discussed in Chapter 7 of 
Robert Penner's Programming Macromedia Flash MX
(including graphs of the easing equations)
