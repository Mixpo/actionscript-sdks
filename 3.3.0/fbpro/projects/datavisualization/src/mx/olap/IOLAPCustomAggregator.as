 *  The IOLAPCustomAggregator interface defines the interface

 *  An instance of a class that implements this interface can be passed to an OLAPMeasure
 *  object to define the aggregation type of the measure. 
 *
 *  <p>You use the methods of this interface in two groups. The first group consists of the
 *  <code>computeBegin()</code>, <code>computeLoop()</code>, and <code>computeEnd()</code> methods. 
 *  Use these methods to compute an aggregation of the values of a measure.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The second group consists of the
 *  <code>computeObjectBegin()</code>, <code>computeObjectLoop()</code>, 
 *  and <code>computeObjectEnd()</code> methods. 
 *  Use these methods to compute an aggregation of aggregated values.</p>
