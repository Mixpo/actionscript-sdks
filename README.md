Ationscript-SDKs
=================

The Adobe SDKS needed to compile parts of our projects.  These SDK's are publically available; however, with much of Adobe Flash being sunset, it's good to have these buisness critical SDK's locally.

- FlexSDK 3.3.0 is to support legacy builds of Flash 9 players
- FlexSDK 4.12.1 is to support current builds of the Flash 10.1 players and Studio
- FlexSDK 3.5.0.12683B is to compile the custom FlexUnit tools utilized by our build process.
